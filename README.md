This repository contains a collection of network lab experiments implemented using the C programming language. Each experiment focuses on a different aspect of networking and provides practical hands-on experience in network programming and protocols. List of Experiments
1. Client-Server Communication with TCP:

    Utilize TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) as the transport layer protocol.
    Implement client-server communication using socket programming.
    Establish a reliable, connection-oriented communication channel between the client and server.

2. Client-Server Communication with UDP:

    Implement client-server communication using socket programming.
    Utilize UDP (User Datagram Protocol) as the transport layer protocol.
    Demonstrate connectionless communication with lower overhead compared to TCP.

3. Sliding Window Flow Control Protocols:

    Simulate sliding window flow control protocols.
    Experiment with the following protocols:
        Stop and Wait ARQ (Automatic Repeat Request)
        Go back N ARQ
        Selective Repeat ARQ
    Observe and analyze the performance of each protocol in terms of efficiency and reliability.

4. Distance Vector Routing Protocol:

    Implement and simulate the algorithm for Distance Vector Routing protocol.
    Study the mechanism for exchanging routing information among routers in a network.
    Observe the convergence of the routing tables and the overall efficiency of the protocol.

5. Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP):

    Implement the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol.
    Enable email communication between clients and servers using SMTP commands.
    Understand the basics of email transmission and the role of SMTP in the process.

6. File Transfer Protocol (FTP):

    Implement the File Transfer Protocol.
    Enable efficient file transfers between clients and servers using FTP commands.
    Study the mechanisms of file upload, download, and directory management.

7. Congestion Control with Leaky Bucket Algorithm:

    Implement congestion control using the leaky bucket algorithm.
    Simulate the flow of data packets through a network with limited bandwidth.
    Demonstrate how the leaky bucket algorithm regulates the flow of packets to prevent congestion.
